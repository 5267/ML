    "#### Introduction\n",
    "Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning is going to be our biggest helper in coming decade!\n",
    "\n",
    "Today morning, I was reading an article which reported that an AI system won against 20 lawyers and the lawyers were actually happy that AI can take care of repetitive part of their roles and help them work on complex topics. These lawyers were happy that AI will enable them to have more fulfilling roles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today, I will be sharing a similar example – How to count number of people in crowd using Deep Learning and Computer Vision, [analyticsvidhya在线课程](https://trainings.analyticsvidhya.com/courses/course-v1:AnalyticsVidhya+CVDL101+CVDL101_T1/about)?  But, before we do that – let us develop a sense of how easy the life is for a Crowd Counting Scientist.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### 1、What is Crowd Counting?\n",
    "Crowd Counting is a technique to count or estimate the number of people in an image. Take a moment to analyze the below image:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Alt text](https://github.com/5267/ML/blob/master/resources/scenario_pics/crowdcounting/IMG_2-850x592%20(1).jpg?raw=true)\n",
    "\n",
    "Can you give me an approximate number of how many people are in the frame? Yes, including the ones present way in the background. The most direct method is to manually count each person but does that make practical sense? It’s nearly impossible when the crowd is this big!\n",
    "\n",
    "Crowd scientists (yes, that’s a real job title!) count the number of people in certain parts of an image and then extrapolate to come up with an estimate. More commonly, we have had to rely on crude metrics to estimate this number for decades.\n",
    "\n",
    "Surely there must be a better, more exact approach?\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, there is!\n",
    "\n",
    "While we don’t yet have algorithms that can give us the EXACT number, most computer vision techniques can produce impressively precise estimates. Let’s first understand why crowd counting is important before diving into the algorithm behind it.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2、Why is Crowd Counting useful?\n",
    "Let’s understand the usefulness of crowd counting using an example. Picture this – your company just finished hosting a huge data science conference. Plenty of different sessions took place during the event.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are asked to analyze and estimate the number of people who attended each session. This will help your team understand what kind of sessions attracted the biggest crowds (and which ones failed in that regard). This will shape next year’s conference, so it’s an important task!\n",
    "\n",
    "![Alt text](https://github.com/5267/ML/blob/master/resources/scenario_pics/crowdcounting/IMG_2-850x592%20(1).jpg?raw=true)\n",
    "\n",
    "There were hundreds of people at the event – counting them manually will take days! That’s where your data scientist skills kick in. You managed to get photos of the crowd from each session and build a computer vision model to do the rest!\n",
    "\n",
    "There are plenty of other scenarios where crowd counting algorithms are changing the way industries work:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Counting the number of people attending a sporting event\n",
    "- Estimating how many people attended an inauguration or a march (political rallies, perhaps)\n",
    "- Monitoring of high-traffic areas\n",
    "- Helping with staffing allocation and resource allotment\n",
    "\n",
    "Can you come up with some other use cases? Let me know in the [issues](https://github.com/5267/ML/issues) section! We can connect and try to figure out how we can use crowd counting techniques in your scenario.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3、 Understanding the Different Computer Vision Techniques for Crowd Counting\n",
    "Broadly speaking, there are currently four methods we can use for counting the number of people in a crowd:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Detection-based methods\n",
    "Here, we use a moving window-like detector to identify people in an image and count how many there are. The methods used for detection require well trained classifiers that can extract low-level features. Although these methods work well for detecting faces, they do not perform well on crowded images as most of the target objects are not clearly visible.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Regression-based methods\n",
    "We were unable to extract low level features using the above approach. Regression-based methods come up trumps here. We first crop patches from the image and then, for each patch, extract the low level features.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Density estimation-based methods\n",
    "We first create a density map for the objects. Then, the algorithm learn a linear mapping between the extracted features and their object density maps. We can also use random forest regression to learn non-linear mapping.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. CNN-based methods\n",
    "Ah, good old reliable convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Instead of looking at the patches of an image, we build an end-to-end regression method using CNNs. This takes the entire image as input and directly generates the crowd count. CNNs work really well with regression or classification tasks, and they have also proved their worth in generating density maps.\n",
    "\n",
    "CSRNet, a technique we will implement in this article, deploys a deeper CNN for capturing high-level features and generating high-quality density maps without expanding the network complexity. Let’s understand what CSRNet is before jumping to the coding section.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4、Understanding the Architecture and Training Method of CSRNet\n",
    "CSRNet uses VGG-16 as the front end because of its strong transfer learning ability. The output size from VGG is ⅛th of the original input size. CSRNet also uses dilated convolutional layers in the back end.\n",
    "\n",
    "But what in the world are dilated convolutions? It’s a fair question to ask. Consider the below image:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Alt text](https://github.com/5267/ML/blob/master/resources/scenario_pics/crowdcounting/Screenshot-from-2019-02-01-16-49-21.png?raw=true)\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic concept of using dilated convolutions is to enlarge the kernel without increasing the parameters. So, if the dilation rate is 1, we take the kernel and convolve it on the entire image. Whereas, if we increase the dilation rate to 2, the kernel extends as shown in the above image (follow the labels below each image). It can be an alternative to pooling layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4.1 Underlying Mathematics\n",
    "I’m going to take a moment to explain how the mathematics work，This will come in handy when you need to tweak or modify your model.\n",

    "\n",
    "Consider an example where we have to predict the price of a house. The variables we are given are the size of the house in square feet (or square meters) and the price of the house. Now assume we have 6 houses. So first let’s pull up a plot to visualize what we’re looking at:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Alt text](https://github.com/5267/ML/blob/master/resources/scenario_pics/deeplearning/1.png?raw=true)\n",
    "\n",
    "On the x-axis, we have the size of the house and on the y-axis we have it’s corresponding price. A linear regression model will try to draw a straight line to fit the data:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Alt text](https://github.com/5267/ML/blob/master/resources/scenario_pics/deeplearning/2.png?raw=true)\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the input(x) here is the size of the house and output(y) is the price. Now let’s look at how we can solve this using a simple neural network:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Alt text](https://github.com/5267/ML/blob/master/resources/scenario_pics/deeplearning/3.png?raw=true)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, a neuron will take an input, apply some activation function to it, and generate an output. One of the most commonly used activation function is **ReLU** (Rectified Linear Unit):\n",
    "\n",
    "![Alt text](https://github.com/5267/ML/blob/master/resources/scenario_pics/deeplearning/4.png?raw=true)\n",
    "\n",
    "ReLU takes a real number as input and returns the maximum of 0 or that number. So, if we pass 10, the output will be 10, and if the input is -10, the output will be 0\n",
    "\n",
    "For now let’s stick to our example. If we use the ReLU activation function to predict the price of a house based on its size, this is how the predictions may look:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Alt text](https://github.com/5267/ML/blob/master/resources/scenario_pics/deeplearning/5.png?raw=true)\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, we have seen a neural network with a single neuron, i.e., we only had one feature (size of the house) to predict the house price. But in reality, we’ll have to consider multiple features like number of bedrooms, postal code, etc.? House price can also depend on the family size, neighbourhood location or school quality. How can we define a neural network in such cases?\n",
    "\n",
    "![Alt text](https://github.com/5267/ML/blob/master/resources/scenario_pics/deeplearning/6.png?raw=true)\n",
    "\n",
    "It gets a bit complicated here. Refer to the above image as you read – we pass 4 features as input to the neural network as x, it automatically identifies some hidden features from the input, and finally generates the output y. This is how a neural network with 4 inputs and an output with single hidden layer will look like:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Alt text](https://github.com/5267/ML/blob/master/resources/scenario_pics/deeplearning/7.png?raw=true)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have an intuition of what neural networks are, let’s see how we can use them for supervised learning problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Supervised Learning with Neural Networks**\n",
    "\n",
    "Supervised learning refers to a task where we need to find a function that can map input to corresponding outputs (given a set of input-output pairs). We have a defined output for each given input and we train the model on these examples. Below is a pretty handy table that looks at the different applications of supervised learning and the different types of neural networks that can be used to solve those problems:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input (X) | Output (y)\t| Application\t| Type of Neural Network \n",

    "Below is a visual representation of the most common Neural Network types:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Alt text](https://github.com/5267/ML/blob/master/resources/scenario_pics/deeplearning/8.png?raw=true)\n",
    "\n",
    "As you might be aware, supervised learning can be used on both structured and unstructured data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our house price prediction example, the given data tells us the size and the number of bedrooms. This is **structured data**, meaning that each feature, such as the size of the house, the number of bedrooms, etc. has a very well defined meaning.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, **unstructured data** refers to things like **audio, raw audio, or images** where you might want to recognize what’s in the image or text (like object detection). Here, the features might be the pixel values in an image, or the individual words in a piece of text. It’s not really clear what each pixel of the image represents and therefore this falls under the unstructured data umbrella.\n",
    "\n",
    "Simple machine learning algorithms work well with structured data. But when it comes to unstructured data, their performance tends to take quite a dip. This is where neural networks have proven to be so effective and useful. They **perform exceptionally well on unstructured data**. Most of the ground-breaking research these days has neural networks at it’s core.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why is Deep Learning Taking off?**\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand this, take a look at the below graph:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Alt text](https://github.com/5267/ML/blob/master/resources/scenario_pics/deeplearning/9.png?raw=true)\n",
    "\n",
    "As the amount of data increases, the performance of traditional learning algorithms, like SVM and logistic regression, does not improve by a whole lot. In fact, it tends to plateau after a certain point. In the case of neural networks, the performance of the model increases with an increase in the data you feed to the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are basically three scales that drive a typical deep learning process:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Data\n",
    "2. Computation Time\n",
    "3. Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "To improve the computation time of the model, activation function plays an important role. If we use a sigmoid activation function, this is what we end up with:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Alt text](https://github.com/5267/ML/blob/master/resources/scenario_pics/deeplearning/10.png?raw=true)\n",
    "\n",
    "The slope, or the gradient of this function, at the extreme ends is close to zero. Therefore, the parameters are updated very slowly, resulting in very slow learning. Hence, switching from a sigmoid activation function to ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) is one of the biggest breakthroughs we have seen in neural networks. ReLU updates the parameters much faster as the slope is 1 when x>0. This is the primary reason for faster computation of the models.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.2 Module 2: Introduction to Deep Learning\n",
    "This module is further divided into two parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Part I: Logistic Regression as a Neural Network\n",
    "- Part II: Python and Vectorization\n",
    "\n",
    "**Part I: Logistic Regression as a Neural Network**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Binary Classification**\n",
    "\n",
    "In a binary classification problem, we have an input x, say an image, and we have to classify it as having a cat or not. If it is a cat, we will assign it a 1, else 0. So here, we have only two outputs – either the image contains a cat or it does not. This is an example of a binary classification problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can of course use the most popular classification technique, logistic regression, in this case.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Logistic Regression**\n",
    "\n",
    "We have an input X (image) and we want to know the probability that the image belongs to class 1 (i.e. a cat). For a given X vector, the output will be:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$y = w^TX + b$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here **w** and **b** are the parameters. Since our output y is probability, it should range between 0 and 1. But in the above equation, it can take any real value, which doesn’t make sense for getting the probability. So logistic regression also uses a sigmoid function to output probabilities:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\hat{y} = \\sigma(w^Tx + b)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For any value as input, it will only return values in the 0 to 1 range. The formula for a sigmoid function is:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\sigma(z)= \\frac{1}{1+e^{-z}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So, if z is very large, exp(-z) will be close to 0, and therefore the output of the sigmoid will be 1. Similarly, if z is very small, exp(-z) will be infinity and hence the output of the sigmoid will be 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the parameter w is nx dimensional vector, and b is a real number. Now let’s look at the cost function for logistic regression\n",
    "\n",
    "**Logistic Regression Cost Function**\n",
    "\n",
    "To train the parameters w and b of logistic regression, we need a cost function. We want to find parameters w and b such that at least on the training set, the outputs you have (y-hat) are close to the actual values (y).\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use a loss function defined below:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$L(\\hat{y},y) = \\frac{1}{2}(\\hat{y}-y)^2$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem with this function is that the optimization problem becomes non-convex, resulting in multiple local optima. Hence, gradient descent will not work well with this loss function. So, for logistic regression, we define a different loss function that plays a similar role as that of the above loss function and also solves the optimization problem by giving a convex function:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$L(\\hat{y},y) = -(ylog\\hat{y} + (1-y)log(1-\\hat{y})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We want our cost function to be as small as possible. For that, we want our parameters w and b to be optimized.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Gradient Descent**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a technique that helps to learn the parameters w and b in such a way that the cost function is minimized. The cost function for logistic regression is convex in nature (i.e. only one global minima) and that is the reason for choosing this function instead of the squared error (can have multiple local minima).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s look at the steps for gradient descent:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Initialize w and b (usually initialized to 0 for logistic regression)\n",
    "2. Take a step in the steepest downhill direction\n",
    "3. Repeat step 2 until global optimum is achieved\n",
    "\n",
    "![Alt text](https://github.com/5267/ML/blob/master/resources/scenario_pics/deeplearning/11.png?raw=true)\n",
    "\n",
    "The updated equation for gradient descent becomes:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$w:=w-\\alpha\\frac{dJ(w)}{dw}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, ⍺ is the learning rate that controls how big a step we should take after each iteration.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we are on the right side of the graph shown above, the slope will be positive. Using the updated equation, we will move to the left (i.e. downward direction) until the global minima is reached. Whereas if we are on the left side, the slope will be negative and hence we will take a step towards the right (downward direction) until the global minima is reached. Pretty intuitive, right?\n",
    "\n",
    "The updated equations for the parameters of logistic regression are:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$w:=w-\\alpha\\frac{dJ(w,b)}{dw}$$\n",
    "$$b:=b-\\alpha\\frac{dJ(w,b)}{db}$$\n",

    "There is still one question left after this – what should be the length of these training, dev and test sets? It’s actually a pretty critical aspect of any machine learning project, and will end up playing a big part in deciding how well the model performs. Let’s look at some traditional guidelines that experts follow to decide the length of each set:\n",

    "\n",
    "This is certainly one way of deciding the length of these different sets. This works fine most of the time, but indulge me and consider the following scenario:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Suppose we have scraped multiple images of cats from different sites, and also clicked a few images using our own camera. The distribution of both these types of images will be different, right? Now, we split the data in such a way that the training set contains all the scraped images, while the dev and test sets have all the camera images. In this case, the distribution of the training set will be different from the dev and test sets and hence, there’s a good chance we might not get good results.\n",
    "    \n",
    "In cases like these (different distributions), we can follow the following guidelines:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Divide the training, dev and test sets in such a way that their distribution is similar\n",
    "2. Skip the test set and validate the model using the dev set only\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also use these sets to look at the bias and variance of the model, These help us decide how well the model is fitting and performing.\n",

    "\n",
    "What will happen if we fit a straight line to classify the points into different classes? The model will under-fit and have a high bias. On the other hand, if we fit the data perfectly, i.e., all the points are classified into their respective class, we will have high variance (and overfitting). The right model fit is usually found between these two extremes:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Alt text]()\n",
    "\n",
    "We want our model to be just right, which means having **low bias and low variance**. We can decide if the model should have high bias or high variance by checking the train set and dev set error. Generally, we can define it as:\n",

    "\n",
    "**Question 1: Does the model have high bias（underfitting）?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution**: We can figure out whether the model has high bias by looking at the training set error. High training error results in high bias. In such cases, we can try bigger networks, train models for a longer period of time, or try different neural network architectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Question 2: Does the model have high variance（overfitting）?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Solution** : If the dev set error is high, we can say that the model has high variance. To reduce the variance, we can get more data, use regularization, or try different neural network architectures.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most popular techniques to reduce variance is called regularization. Let’s look at this concept and how it applies to neural networks in part II.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Part II: Regularizing your Neural Network\n",
    "\n",
    "We can reduce the variance by increasing the amount of data. But is that really a feasible option every time? Perhaps there is no other data available, and if there is, it might be too expensive for your project to source. This is quite a common problem. And that’s why the concept of regularization plays an important role in preventing overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Regularization**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s take the example of logistic regression. We try to minimize the loss function:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Alt text]()\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, if we add regularization to this cost function, it will look like:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Alt text]()\n",
    "\n",
    "This is called L2 regularization. ƛ is the regularization parameter which we can tune while training the model. Now, let’s see how to use regularization for a neural network. The cost function for a neural network can be written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Alt text]()\n",
    "\n",
    "We can add a regularization term to this cost function (just like we did in our logistic regression equation):\n",
    "\n",
    "![Alt text]()\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, let’s see how regularization works for a gradient descent algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Update equation without regularization is given by:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Alt text]()\n",
    "\n",
    "Regularized form of these update equations will be:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Alt text]()\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can surmise from the above equations, the reduction in weights will be more in case of regularization (since we are adding a higher quantity from the weights). This is the reason L2 regularization is also known as weight decay.\n",
    "\n",
    "You must be wondering at this point how in the world does regularization prevent overfitting in the model? Let’s try to understand it in the next section.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How does regularization reduce overfitting?**\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary reason overfitting happens is because the model learns even the tiniest details present in the data. So after learning all the possible patterns it can find, the model tends to perform extremely well on the training set but fails to produce good results on the dev and test sets. It falls apart when faced with previously unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to prevent overfitting is to **reduce the complexity** of the model. This is exactly what regularization does! If we set the regularization parameter (ƛ) to a large value, the decay in the weights during gradient descent update will be more. Hence, the weights of most of the hidden units will be close to zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the weights are negligible, the model will not learn much from these units.This will **end up making the network simpler and thus reduce overfitting**:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Alt text]()\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s understand this concept through one more example. Suppose we use the tanh activation function:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Alt text]()\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, if we set ƛ to a large value, the weight of the units w[l] will be less. To calculate the z[l] value, we will use the following formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Alt text]()\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, the z-value will be less. If we use the tanh activation function, these low values of z[l] will lie near the origin:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Alt text]()\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we are using only the linear region of the tanh function. This will make every layer in the network roughly linear, i.e., we will get linear boundaries that separate the data, thus preventing overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Dropout Regularization**\n",
    "\n",
    "There is one more technique we can use to perform regularization. Consider you are building a neural network as shown below:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Alt text]()\n",
    "\n",
    "This neural network is overfitting on the training data. Suppose we add a dropout of 0.5 to all these images. The model will randomly remove 50% of the units from each layer and we finally end up with a much simpler network:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Alt text]()\n",
    "\n",
    "This has proven to be a very effective regularization technique. How can we implement it ourselves? Let’s check it out!\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be working on this very example where we have three hidden layers. For now, we will consider the third layer, l=3. The dropout vector d for the third hidden layer can be written as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$d^3 = np.random.rand(a^3.shape[0], a^3.shape[1]) < keep\\_prob$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, keep_prob is the probability of keeping a unit. Now, we will calculate the activations for the selected units:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$a^3 = np.multiply(a^3,d^3)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This $a^3$ value will be reduced by a factor of (1-keep_probs). So to get the expected value of $a^3$, we divide the value:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$a^3 /= keep\\_dims$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s understand the concept of dropout using an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Number of units in the layer = 50\n",
    "keep_prob = 0.8\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So, 20% of the total units (i.e. 10) will be randomly shut off.\n",
    "\n",
    "Different sets of hidden layers are dropped randomly in each training iteration. Note that dropout is only done at the time of training the model (not during the test phase). The reason for doing this is because:\n",
    "\n",
    "- We don’t want our outputs to be random\n",
    "- Dropout adds noise to the predictions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Other Regularization Methods**\n",
    "\n",
    "Apart from L2 regularization and dropout, there are a few other techniques that can be used to reduce overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Augmentation**: Suppose we are building an image classification model and are lacking the requisite data due to various reasons. In such cases, we can use data augmentation, i.e., applying some changes such as flipping the image, taking random crops of the image, randomly rotating images, etc. These can potentially help us get more training data and hence reduce overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Early Stopping**: To understand this, consider the below example:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Alt text]()\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the training error is continuously decreasing with respect to time. On the other hand, the dev set error is decreasing initially before increasing after a few iterations. We can stop the training at the point where the dev set error starts to increase. This, in a nutshell, is called early stopping.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Part III: Setting up your Optimization Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "In this module, we will discuss the different techniques that can be used to speed up the training process.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Normalizing Inputs**\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we have 2 input features and their scatter plot looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Alt text]()\n",

    "This is how we can represent the input as a vector:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Alt text]()\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Subtract the mean from the input features:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Alt text]()\n",
    "\n",
    "This will change the scatter plot from what is shown above to (notice that the variables have much higher variance in this graph):\n",
    "\n",
    "![Alt text]()\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Next, we normalize the variance:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Alt text]()\n",
    "\n",
    "We divide the features with the variance. This will make the input look like:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Alt text]()\n",
    "\n",
    "A key point to note is that we use the same mean and variance to normalize the test set as well. We should do this because we want the same transformation to happen on both the train and test data.\n",
    "\n",
    "But why does normalizing the data make the algorithm faster?\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of unnormalized data, the scale of features will vary, and hence there will be a variation in the parameters learnt for each feature. This will make the cost function asymmetric:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Alt text]()\n",
    "\n",
    "![Alt text]()\n",
    "\n",
    "Whereas, in the case of normalized data, the scale will be the same and the cost function will also be symmetric:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Alt text]()\n",
    "\n",
    "![Alt text]()\n",
    "\n",
    "Normalizing the inputs makes the cost function symmetric. This makes it is easier for the gradient descent algorithm to find the global minima more quickly. And this, in turn, makes the algorithm run much faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Vanishing / Exploding gradients**\n",
    "\n",
    "While training deep neural networks, sometimes the derivatives (slopes) can become either very big or very small. It can make the training phase quite difficult.

    "\n",
    "![Alt text]()\n",
    "\n",
    "For deeper networks, L will be large, making the gradients very large and the learning process slow. Similarly, using small weights will make the gradients very small, and as a result, learning will be **fast**. We must deal with this problem in order to reduce the training time. So **how should the weights be initialized?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Weight Initialization for Deep Networks**\n",
    "\n",
    "One potential solution to this problem can be random initialization. Consider a single neuron as shown below:\n",

    "\n",
    "For this example, we can initialize the weights as:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Alt text]()\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary reason behind initializing the weights randomly is to break symmetry. We want to make sure that different hidden units learn different patterns. There is one more technique that can help ensure that our implementations are correct and will run quickly.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Gradient Checking**\n",
    "\n",
    "Gradient checking is used to find bugs (if any) in the implementation of backpropagation. Consider the following graph:\n",

    "The derivative of the function w.r.to Θ can be best expressed as:\n",

    "Where ε is the small step which we take towards the left and right of Θ. Make sure that the derivative calculated above is nearly equal to the actual derivative of the function. Below are the steps we follow for gradient checking:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Take W[1], b[1],…., w[L], b[L] and reshape it into a big vector Θ:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Alt text]()\n",
    "\n",
    "2. We also calculate dW[1], db[1],…, dw[L], db[L] and reshape it into a big vector dΘ\n",

    "We want this value to be as small as possible. So, if ε is 10-7, we say it is a great approximation, If ε is 10-5, it is acceptable, and if ε is in the range 10-3, we have to change the approximations and recalculate the weights.\n",

Instead, we can use a mini batch of the training examples and update the weights based on them.\n",

    "2. If the mini-batch size = 1:\n",
    "\n",
    "It is called stochastic gradient descent, where each training example is its own mini-\n",
